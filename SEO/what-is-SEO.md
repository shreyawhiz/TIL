SEO stands for **Search Engine Optimization**


So, SEO is basically a marketing discipline focused on growing visibility in organic (non-paid) search engine results. 
Google, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, and Bing are constantly trying to view a website, and SEO encompasses both the technical and creative elements required to improve rankings, drive traffic, and increase awareness in search engines.


>So why does a website need SEO?

The majority of web traffic is driven by the major commercial search engines, Google, Bing, and Yahoo!. 
Although social media and other types of traffic can generate visits to your website, search engines are the primary method of navigation for most Internet users.

Search engines have two major functions: **crawling** and **building an index**, and providing search users with a ranked list of the websites they've determined are the most relevant.

If search engines cannot find your site, or add your content to their databases, you miss out on incredible opportunities to drive traffic to your site.

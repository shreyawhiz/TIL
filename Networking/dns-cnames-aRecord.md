``What is DNS?``

DNS, which stands for ``domain name system``, controls your domain name's website and email settings.
When visitors go to your domain name, its DNS settings control which company's server it reaches out to.

For example, if you use GoDaddy's DNS settings, visitors will reach GoDaddy's servers when using your domain name.
If you change those settings to user another company's servers, visitors will reach them instead of GoDaddy when visiting your domain.

DNS can be confusing. It's made up of many different elements that control different aspects of your domain name

1. Nameserver
---------------
Nameservers "point" your domain name to the company that controls its DNS settings. Usually, this will be the company where you registered the domain name.

However, if your website is hosted by another company, sometimes they will provide nameservers you need to point to instead.

2. Zone File
-------------
Zone Files are simply the files that store all of your domain's DNS settings.

Your domain name's Zone File is stored on the company's nameserver.

3. A Record
-----------
A Records point your domain name to an individual server using an IP address.
The A record maps a name to one or more IP addresses, when the IP are known and stable.

4. CNAME
---------
CNAMEs point your subdomains to another server using a server name, like server1.godaddy.com.
The CNAME record maps a name to another name.
